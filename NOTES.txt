https://www.sslforfree.com -> domain: paligator.sk www.paligator.sk photo-lib-api.paligator.sk photo-lib.paligator.sk
ssl certificate "ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/photolib/photolib_chain.crt;" must be chained, it means my cert + cert of ca, you can do it with command:
cat photolib.crt photolib_ca.crt >> photolib_chain.crt
there was a problem with line between these two certs, you must open photolib_chain.crt and add line between them
reason: https://gtmetrix.com would error "The SSL certificate for this site is not trusted in all web browsers"
disable in nginx defautl and add sslForFree config
